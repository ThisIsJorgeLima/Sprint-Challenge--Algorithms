You have been given a robot with very basic capabilities:

It can move left or right.
It can pick up an item
If it tries to pick up an item while already holding one, it will swap the items instead.
It can compare the item it's holding to the item in front of it.
It can switch a light on its head on or off.
Your task is to program this robot to sort lists using ONLY these abilities.

RÌ²uÌ²lÌ²eÌ²sÌ²:Ì²
Inside the robot_sort directory you'll find the robot_sort.py file. Open it up and read through each of the robot's abilities. Once you've understood those, start filling out the sort() method following these rules:

You may use logical operators. (if, and, or, not, etc.)
You may use comparison operators. (>, >=, <, <=, ==, is, etc.)
You may use iterators. (while, for, break, continue)

You may define robot helper methods, as long as they follow all the rules.

"""
Hints
Make sure you understand the problem and all of the rules!
A solution that breaks the rules will not receive full credit.

If you're unsure if an operator or method is allowed, ask.

Lay out some numbered cards in a line and try sorting them as if you were the robot.

Come up with a plan and write out your algorithm before coding. If your plan is sound but you don't reach a working implementation in three hours, you may receive partial credit.

There is no efficiency requirement but you may lose points for an unreasonably slow solution. Tests should run in far less than 1 second.

We discussed a sorting method this week that might be useful. Which one?

The robot has exactly one bit of memory: its light. Why is this important?
