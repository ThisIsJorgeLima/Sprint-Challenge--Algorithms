"""
You have been given a robot with very basic capabilities:

It can move left or right.
It can pick up an item
If it tries to pick up an item while already holding one, it will swap the items instead.
It can compare the item it's holding to the item in front of it.
It can switch a light on its head on or off.
Your task is to program this robot to sort lists using ONLY these abilities.

R̲u̲l̲e̲s̲:̲
Inside the robot_sort directory you'll find the robot_sort.py file. Open it up and read through each of the robot's abilities. Once you've understood those, start filling out the sort() method following these rules:

Y̲o̲u̲ m̲a̲y̲ u̲s̲e̲ a̲n̲y̲ p̲r̲e̲-̲d̲e̲f̲i̲n̲e̲d̲ r̲o̲b̲o̲t̲ m̲e̲t̲h̲o̲d̲s̲.̲

You may use logical operators. (if, and, or, not, etc.)
You may use comparison operators. (>, >=, <, <=, ==, is, etc.)
You may use iterators. (while, for, break, continue)
Y̶o̶u̶ m̶a̶y̶ N̶O̶T̶ s̶t̶o̶r̶e̶ a̶n̶y̶ v̶a̶r̶i̶a̶b̶l̶e̶s̶.̶ (=)
Y̶o̶u̶ m̶a̶y̶ N̶O̶T̶ a̶c̶c̶e̶s̶s̶ a̶n̶y̶ i̶n̶s̶t̶a̶n̶c̶e̶ v̶a̶r̶i̶a̶b̶l̶e̶s̶ d̶i̶r̶e̶c̶t̶l̶y̶.̶ (̶s̶e̶l̶f̶.̶_̶a̶n̶y̶t̶h̶i̶n̶g̶)̶

You may define robot helper methods, as long as they follow all the rules.

Hints
Make sure you understand the problem and all of the rules!
A solution that breaks the rules will not receive full credit.

If you're unsure if an operator or method is allowed, ask.

Lay out some numbered cards in a line and try sorting them as if you were the robot.

Come up with a plan and write out your algorithm before coding. If your plan is sound but you don't reach a working implementation in three hours, you may receive partial credit.

There is no efficiency requirement but you may lose points for an unreasonably slow solution. Tests should run in far less than 1 second.

We discussed a sorting method this week that might be useful. Which one?

The robot has exactly one bit of memory: its light. Why is this important?
